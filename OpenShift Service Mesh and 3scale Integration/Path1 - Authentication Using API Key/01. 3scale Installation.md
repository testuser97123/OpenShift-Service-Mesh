# Part 1

## Authentication Using API Key

In the part1 of this demo we shall use API_Key as a method of authentication. Before you proceed please type your OpenShift Cluster Wildcard DNS in the box above. You can pick it up from the URL of your Console UI.

The above step is the most important for this lab. The OpenShift Cluster Wildcard DNS should ideally look something like this. apps.cluster-pmjd8.pmjd8.sandbox783.opentlc.com .

## Setup

### Prerequisties

3scale requires a RWX storage for the developer portal. We will leverage the OpenShift Data Foundation for this. The OpenShift Data Foundation needs atleast 3 worker nodes (is they are not configured on your cluster already, please follow the below steps)

### Increase Worker Node Count

1. On your OpenShift Console UI, navigate to Administrator > Compute > Machine Sets and increase the machine count to 3 as shown below

2. Give it a few seconds to confirm the node is up and running

## ODF Installation

The whole lab is going to leverage Operators for installation of all the components. Users can configure the operators either via cli or console.

1. On your OpenShift Console UI, navigate to Administrator > Operators > OperatorHub and search for OpenShift Data Foundation. Leave all the values as Default and click on install.

The operator installation might take a minute or two

2. Wait for the operator to install and when you see the below screen, click on Create StorageSystem

3. Make sure the gp2 StorageClass is selected and click Next

4. Select all the three nodes and leave all the other values as default. Click Next

5. Leave all the values as default. Click Next

6. Click on Create StorageSystem

## 3scale Installation

1. Create a 3scale namespace on your OpenShift Cluster. Navigate to Administrator > Project > Create Project. Type 3scale as the name of the project and create.

2. On your OpenShift Console UI, navigate to Administrator > Operators > OperatorHub and search for 3scale. Select the Red Hat Integration Operator - 3scale. Double check and make sure you are in the 3scale namespace while you do this

3. Click on Install

4. Double check and make sure the 3scale namespace is selected. Leave all the options as default and click Install

5. Once the installation is complete (will take a few seconds). Click on View Operator

6. Now let’s create the API manager. Deploying the APIManager custom resource will make the operator begin processing and will deploy a 3scale solution from it.
7. Click on the API Manager tab > Create APIManager > YAML view >. Remove the the existing yaml and copy paste the code provided in step 3 as shown below


```yml
apiVersion: apps.3scale.net/v1alpha1
kind: APIManager
metadata:
  name: 3scale
spec:
  system:
    fileStorage:
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
    redisResources:
      limits:
        memory: 6Gi
  backend:
    redisResources:
      limits:
        memory: 6Gi
  wildcardDomain: %CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%
```

If the Cluster WildCard URL is not populated already in the above yaml, please enter it the respective text box above. You can find the cluster wildcard url dns of your OpenShift cluster from the Console URL. Make a note of the cluster wildcard url as it’ll be useful later
