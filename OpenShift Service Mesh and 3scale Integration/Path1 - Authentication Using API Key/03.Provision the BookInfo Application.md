# Provision BookInfo

### BookInfo Overview

Bookinfo is a sample microservice architecture application that weâ€™ll be using for our workshop.The application provides details about the book such as publisher details, overview, reviews and ratings through the microservices. The BookInfo Application is deployed to bookinfo namespace

### Deploy BookInfo

1. Create new project with the name 'bookinfo'

```yml
oc new-project bookinfo
```
2. By creating a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource and specifying the namespaces where your content is located, we can add applications, workloads, or services to your mesh .

3. Create a Custom Resource Definition file for the Control Plane with name ServiceMeshMemberRoll_default.yaml using vim or any other editor on the CLI. Copy paste the below yaml into the file and save it.

```yml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  members:
    - bookinfo
```   
 
4. Apply the CRD to your cluster using the below command

```yml
oc apply -f ServiceMeshMemberRoll_default.yaml -n istio-system
```

5. Provision the application by using the below commands.

```yml
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maistra/istio/maistra-2.1/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml -n bookinfo
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maistra/istio/maistra-2.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml -n bookinfo
```

6. You can now verify that the bookinfo service is responding by using reqbin.

7. Open a browser window and navigate to:

```yml
https://reqbin.com/curl
```

8. Copy and paste the below command.

```yml
curl -v http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%/productpage
```

If the CLuster URL is not populated, you can also retrieve the cluster wildcard url using the below command

```yml
oc get ingresscontroller default -n openshift-ingress-operator -o json | jq -r '.status.domain'
```
9. You should see 200 (OK) status
