## Service Mesh Setup

### Service Mesh Control Plane Overview

We will be installing Elasticsearch, Jaeger, and Kiali for tracing and monitoring purposes.

### Elastic Search Operator Installation

1. On your OpenShift Console UI, navigate to Administrator > Operators > OperatorHub and search for OpenShift Elastic Operator. Select the Operator and Click Install.

After all you have installed all four Operators, click Operators â†’ Installed Operators to verify that your Operators installed

## Create Control Plane

The control plane manages and configures the proxies that make up the data plane. It is the authoritative source for configuration, manages access control and usage policies, and collects metrics from the proxies in the service mesh. You can deploy a basic ServiceMeshControlPlane by using the web console or CLI. We will be using the CLI for our demo.

1. Open the terminal on your workstation. SSH into the cluster bastion via the credentials you obtained in your welcome email which should look like the images below

2. Create new project with the name 'istio-system'

```yml
oc new-project istio-system
```


3. Create a Custom Resource Definition file for the Control Plane with name ServiceMeshControlPlane_basic.yaml using vim or any other editor on the cli. Copy paste the below yaml into the file and save it.

```yml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  addons:
    grafana:
      enabled: true
    jaeger:
      install:
        storage:
          type: Memory
    kiali:
      enabled: true
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
  policy:
    type: Istiod
  profiles:
    - default
  telemetry:
    type: Istiod
  tracing:
    sampling: 10000
    type: Jaeger
  version: v2.1
```

Apply the CRD to your cluster using the below command


```yml
oc apply -f ServiceMeshControlPlane_basic.yaml -n istio-system
```
