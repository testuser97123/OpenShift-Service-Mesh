# Enable API Management for bookinfo - OIDC scenario

## Overview

In this section we shall enable the API management for bookinfo application using the 3scale WASM module

### reate Service Entry

If you haven’t created Service Entries as apart of the earlier configuration follow the below instructions. Skip to the next request authentication section if you have already done this in part 1.

1. Create a Custom Resource Definition file for the System Service Entry with name ServiceEntry_system-entry.yaml using vim or any other editor on the CLI. Copy paste the below yaml into the file and save it.

```yml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
 name: system-entry
spec:
 hosts:
   - system-provider.3scale.svc.cluster.local
 location: MESH_EXTERNAL
 ports:
   - name: http
     number: 3000
     protocol: HTTP
 resolution: DNS
```

2. Create a Custom Resource Definition file for the Backend Service Entry with name ServiceEntry_backend-entry.yaml using vim or any other editor on the CLI. Copy paste the below yaml into the file and save it.

```yml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
 name: backend-entry
spec:
 hosts:
   - backend-listener.3scale.svc.cluster.local
 location: MESH_EXTERNAL
 ports:
   - name: http
     number: 3000
     protocol: HTTP
 resolution: DNS
```

3. Apply the CRDs to your cluster using the below command


oc apply -f ServiceEntry_system-entry.yaml -f ServiceEntry_backend-entry.yaml -n bookinfo


### Create Request Authentication

Request authentication when applied to OSSM will validate the JWT token and store the contents in an internal metadata object which will be used by the 3scale WASM module to validate against 3scale.

1. Get the keycloak URL by pasting the below command on the command line where you are logged into the OpenShift Cluster

```yml
oc get route keycloak -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}{.spec.path}" -n keycloak
```

2. Create a Request Authentication Custom Resource Definition file with name RequestAuthentication_bookinfo-oidc.yaml using vim or any other editor on the CLI. Copy paste the below yaml into the file and save it.

```yml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: RequestAuthentication
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-oidc
  namespace: bookinfo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: productpage
  jwtRules:
  - issuer: >-
      https://keycloak-keycloak.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%/auth/realms/threescale
    jwksUri: >-
      https://keycloak-keycloak.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%/auth/realms/threescale/protocol/openid-connect/certs
```

3. Apply the CRD to your cluster using the below command

```yml
oc apply -f RequestAuthentication_bookinfo-oidc.yaml -n bookinfo
```

### Create Service Mesh Extension

The ServiceMeshExtension custom resource spec provides the configuration that the Proxy-WASM module reads from. The spec is embedded in the host and read by the Proxy-WASM module. Follow the below steps to configure the ServiceMeshExtension

1. If you haven’t already noted down the 'Admin Access Token' from 3scale Secret from earlier labs please follow these steps. Retrieve the Admin_Access_token using the Console UI. Select 3scale project and Navigate to Developer > Secrets and search for system-seed

![alt text](imageAPI.png)

2. From the system-seed secret just copy and note down the the Admin_Access_Token

![alt text](../../Images/image-API1.png)

3. The service token wil enable the permission for service mesh to be able to access a particular 3scale product. . The service token wil enable the permission for service mesh to be able to access a particular 3scale product. From the 3scale admin-portal navigate to Account Settings > Personal > Tokens and Copy the Service Token of the product we created earlier

![alt text](../../Images/image-API2.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively you can use 3scale admin access token along with the 3scale product ID from the 3scale product configuration earlier and run the following command with values replaced to obtain the Service token. :


> curl https://3scale-admin.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%/admin/api/services/{product id}/proxy/configs/production/latest.json?access_token={access token} | jq '.proxy_config.content.backend_authentication_value'

Copy and note down the Service Access Token obtained

4. Create a Custom Resource Definition file for the Service Mesh Extension with name ServiceMeshExtension_bookinfo-oidc.yaml using vim or any other editor on the CLI. Copy paste the below yaml into the file and replace the access token, service token, product id values as shown in the image below and save it.

```yml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshExtension
metadata:
 name: bookinfo-oidc
 namespace: bookinfo
spec:
 image: 'registry.redhat.io/openshift-service-mesh/3scale-auth-wasm-rhel8:0.0.1'
 phase: PostAuthZ
 priority: 100
 workloadSelector:
   labels:
     app: productpage
 config:
   api: v1
   system:
     name: system
     token: <replace with 3scale admin access token>
     upstream:
       name: >-
         outbound|3000||system-provider.3scale.svc.cluster.local
       timeout: 5000
       url: 'http://system-provider.3scale.svc.cluster.local'
   backend:

       timeout: 5000
       url: 'http://backend-listener.3scale.svc.cluster.local'
   services:
    - id: '4'
      token: <replace with 3scale product service token>
      authorities:
        - '*'
      credentials:
        app_id:
          - filter:
              path:
                - envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn
                - "0"
              keys:
                - azp
              ops:
                - take:
                    head: 1
      mapping_rules:
        - method: GET
          pattern: /
          usages:
            - delta: 1
              name: hits
```

> [!NOTE]
> 3scale app_id for OIDC matches the OAuth’s client_id typically found in the azp field of the JWT token.

5. Please delete the ServiceMeshExtension if created before else ignore the step

```yml
oc delete sme bookinfo -n bookinfo
```

6. Now Apply the newly created CRD to your cluster using the below command

```yml
oc apply -f ServiceMeshExtension_bookinfo-oidc.yaml -n bookinfo
```

### Authorize an application to consume the API managed

1. Login to 3scale and navigate to Products > wasm-oidc-demo > Applications > Listing and Click Create Application

![alt text](../../Images/image-API4.png)

2. Choose the default Developer Account, wasm-oidc-basic as Application Plan. Give any name and description to the application. Click on Create Application

![alt text](../../Images/image-API5.png)

3. You should now have an Client ID and Client Secret. This is needed to test Client Credentials and Authorization Code flows.

![alt text](../../Images/image-API6.png)

4. This is required to test Authorization Code flow. In the current page where application details are shown, under API Credentials section click Edit and apply(based on the version of the postman) either https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback OR https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback to the Redirect URL

![alt text](../../Images/image-API7.png)

### Verifying the policy enforcement

1. You can now verify the policy enforcement by first calling the endpoint without credentials and then later using the api key.


2. Open a browser window and navigate to:
```yml
https://reqbin.com/curl
```

3. Copy and paste the below command.

```yml
curl -v http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%/api/v1/products
```

4. You should see 403 status.

![alt text](../../Images/image-API8.png)

5. Access with JWT token using Client Credential flow using the Client ID, Client Secret Replace the Client ID and Client Secret in the commands below:

```yml
export SSO_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID>
export SSO_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client Secret>
export SSO_URL=keycloak-keycloak.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%
export TKN=$(curl -k -X POST \
 -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
 -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=$SSO_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$SSO_CLIENT_SECRET" \
 https://$SSO_URL/auth/realms/threescale/protocol/openid-connect/token \
| sed 's/.*access_token":"//g' | sed 's/".*//g')

curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TKN" http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%/api/v1/products
```

### You should see an HTTP 200 response.

Verify the policy enforcement for Authorization Code flow
Postman will be used to test this flow as it has to open the browser to capture the user credentials. So, please install postman if you do not have it

1. Create a new GET request from Postman using the below URL (Do not hit send yet)

```yml
http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%/api/v1/products
```

2. Click on Authorization and select OAUth 2.0 from the Type dropdown

![postman oauth](../../Images/image-API9.png)

3. Make sure you choose and fill in the correct values as shown below.

- Access Token: Available Tokens

- Header Prefix: Bearer

- Grant Type: Authorization Code

- Callback URL: Check the Authorize using browser checkbox

- Auth URL: https://keycloak-keycloak.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%/auth/realms/threescale/protocol/openid-connect/auth

- Access Token URL: https://keycloak-keycloak.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%/auth/realms/threescale/protocol/openid-connect/token

- Client ID: Client Id obtained from 3scale

- Client Secret: Client Secret obtained from 3scale

- Client Authentication: Send as Basic Auth Header

4. After choosing and entering the right values go ahead and hit the Get New Access Token button.

![alt text](../../Images/image-API10.png)

5. The browser should open a login window asking for username and password. Go ahead and enter user1 for the username and openshift for the password

6. Click on Open Postman

![alt text](../../Images/image-API11.png)

7. Wait for the authentication to complete and token to appear. Click on Use Token

![alt text](../../Images/image-API12.png)

8. The token is now populated in the Access Token Field. Now go ahead a hit send

![alt text](../../Images/image-API13.png)

9. You should see a HTTP 200 with response from the API showing the title, ID and Summary of the book.

![alt text](../../Images/image-API14.png)

10. If you make more than 8 calls per minute (recollect the limit we set in our application plans) you should see a 403 status. The count gets refreshed every minute

![alt text](../../Images/image-API15.png)

11. In case you want to verify the calls on Kiali and Jaeger you can send multiple calls via Postman and check the paths and traces on the Kiali and Jaeger interfaces as illustrated in earlier labs.
