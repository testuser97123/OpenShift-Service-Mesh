# Configuring 3Scale Product for OIDC

### 3scale Product Overview

A 3scale product is a customer facing API. Products facilitate the creation of strong and simplified offerings for API consumers. In this section we will configure a 3scale product. Later we will use the Istio Ingress to the BookInfo application (created in the previous step) directly as an API Product in 3scale, using the 3scale Istio WASM module

### Login to 3scale

1. If you are not already logged into 3scale, please follow these steps. Log into 3scale using the below URL

```yml
https://3scale-admin.%CLUSTER_WILDCARD_URL%
```

2. You can retrieve the login credentials using the OpenShift Console UI. Select 3scale project and Navigate to Developer > Secrets and search for system-seed

3. From the system-seed secret you can retrieve the admin_access_token (we will use this later in our lab), admin_user, admin_password used to login to 3scale. Login to the 3scale admin portal by using the admin_user and admin_password.
